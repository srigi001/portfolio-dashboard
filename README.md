## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd investment-dashboard-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Configuration

### Authentication Mode

The app can run in two modes:

1. **Local Storage Mode** (default): Data is stored locally in the browser
2. **Google Auth Mode**: Data is synced to Supabase with Google authentication

To switch modes, update the `USE_GOOGLE_AUTH` flag in `src/utils/config.ts`.

### Supabase Setup (Optional)

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Set up Google OAuth provider
3. Update the Supabase configuration in `src/utils/supabaseClient.js`
